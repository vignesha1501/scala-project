You can also create a DataFrame from different sources like Text, CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet, Avro, ORC, Binary files, RDBMS Tables, Hive, HBase, and many more.

DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. 
It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data frame in R/Python, 
but with richer optimizations under the hood. 
DataFrames can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as: structured data files, 
tables in Hive, external databases, or existing RDDs.
